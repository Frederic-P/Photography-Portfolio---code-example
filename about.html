    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hi there,</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Short Bio</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I was born somewhere in 1993 in Ostend, Belgium. Primary and secondary school were pretty uneventful. I started my Bachelor's degree
    in history at the KULAK, a small campus of the KU Leuven in Kortrijk. I finished my degree in Leuven where I also followed a teaching-course and a
    master of science in the field of Digital Humanities. Photography was something I learned by doing, mostly messing about and learning from some YouTube videos.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>Photography</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="Images/Xeena-web.jpg" alt="Human, get out of there... I'm so tired of your sh*t" class="inlineimage">
    <p>As far as I can tell I've always been taken away by photography and have always enjoyed the stories these images could tell.
    It was only when getting older that I actually 'picked up the camera' and dipped my toe in the whole photography-craze and it took an
    even longer time to make the transition from snapshot to anything decent.</p>
    <p>I like to experiment with new techniques, styles and subjects, though I enjoy landscape and wildlife photography the most. In general, being in the
    great outdoors is always a great excuse to bring a camera along. My loyal four-legged companion - although utterly clueless - is of course always
    game to explore the next dune or corner. </p>
    <p>There are quite a few photographers whose work I find absolutely amazing; yet the one that got me interested in the medium for the first time was
        <a href="http://www.thomasmarent.com/" target="_blank">the Swiss wildlife photographer Thomas Marent.</a> One of the landscape photographers
    whose work I admire is <a href="http://www.davidnoton.com/" target="_blank">UK based photographer David Noton</a>. Photography is also about people and stories;
    two concepts which I find masterfully grasped in the portraits by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/roberto.donadello.ph" target="_blank">Roberto Donadello</a>.
    Finally I should mention <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NorthrupPhotography" target="_blank">Chelsea and Tony Northrup</a>, a photographing couple that provides
        excellent books and online courses.</p>
